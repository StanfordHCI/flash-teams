    	Dear <%= @dri_role %>,<br><br>
		Flash Teams must inform you that <%= @event_name %> is running late. 
		<%= link_to 'Please fill out this form', @url %>
		to give other team members an estimate of how long it takes to finish the delayed task. If we do not hear back from you in <%= @minutes %> minutes, we will notify other team members anyway.
